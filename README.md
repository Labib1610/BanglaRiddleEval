# _Can LLMs Solve My Grandma’s Enigmas?_ Evaluating Multilingual Large Language Models on Reasoning Traditional Bangla Tricky Riddles

_Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive performance on many NLP benchmarks, yet their ability to reason in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings remains underexplored. We address this gap for Bangla by introducing \textsc{BanglaRiddleEval}, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (\textbf{4,976} riddle--task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about $56\%$ versus an $83\%$ human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly $26\%$ to $68\%$, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models. These results show that current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing \textsc{BanglaRiddleEval} as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning._
